- 👋 Hi, I’m @surfingjoe
- 👀 I’m interested in developing AWS projects to help others study AWS , I'm interested in automation of AWS (most likely with Ansible & Fargate)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning AWS Solution Architecture, Ansible
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Ansible projects & establishing good practice projects for those learning AWS architcture
- 📫 How to reach me surfingjoe2@gmail.com

There are many ways to automate in AWS, using CloudDeploy, CloudFormation, Elastic BeanStalk, Opsworks and/or launch templates for autoscaling.  So far, I have found each of these methods, while fairly easy to write in JSON or YAML, are a bit unforgiving when mistakes occur in the code and error messages sometimes misleading or down right deceptive.  There exists a good set of out of the box architectures available to businesses.  

Recently, I have had tremendous success launching infrastructure as code using Ansible and I am in the process of creating study projects using Ansible.  Ansible is open source, with the ability to setup RedHat support contracts.  So price wise, very attractive and massively successful in many businesses.

My intention will be to also try Terraform, it is free to use for under 5 users, so I'll give that a shot as well.
